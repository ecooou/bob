                <p><span class="accent">Problem Statement:</span> College students frequently experience elevated stress levels due to intense academic demands, often neglecting self-care and breaks, which adversely affects their mental and physical health. Design a tangible user interface to help alleviate stress and remind this population to take well-being breaks.
                </p>
                <p><span class="accent">Motivation:</span> Stress among college students is a widespread issue. Our researchers, who are also college students, often find themselves working towards deadlines for hours on end without breaks, resulting in extreme levels of stress. In the long term, this mental stress can have profound effects on mental health, leading to conditions such as anxiety, depression, and other serious issues. Meanwhile, we have observed a rising cultural trend, particularly with brands like Jellycat, where many college students have turned to collecting comforting toys for personal comfort and stress relief. This observation has led us to explore the relationship between personal toys and stress relief.<br>
                Our research aims to leverage these toys as tangible user interfaces (TUIs), offering a new way to interact with college students. Unlike digital self-care applications that often interrupt students' work and can be found annoying and ineffective, the TUI utilizes the physical and tactile qualities of these toys to attract students' attention and conduct effective interventions in an engaging way. It serves as a comforting tool to interact with students, encouraging them to practice self-care methods that help relieve stress and anxiety.
