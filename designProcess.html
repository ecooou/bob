    <h1 class="subheading">User Interview Protocols</h1>
    <p>In order to gain a better understanding of Wellesley students and their relationship with mental health, and specifically with accessing resources provided by the on-campus counseling service, the Stone Center, we created an interview protocol that addressed topics of interest. Our protocol began with an introduction of the purpose of the interview, and we also made sure to assure each of the interviewees of the anonymity of the interview as well as their right to refuse to answer any questions that they were uncomfortable answering, thus maintaining a certain level of trust between the interviewer and the interviewee. Interviews were also mostly conducted within dorm rooms, allowing a more comfortable and personal atmosphere. </p>

    <h1 class="subheading">User Interview Takeaways</h1>
    <p>From our interviews, we gather that many Wellesley students have stress that builds up because of academics, career related worries, and social factors. They often feel as if they cannot talk to other people about their mental health, and if they are struggling they attempt to get over it as quickly as possible due to the continuous academic and social workload. As a result, many students have attempted to seek guidance or therapy from either the Stone Center or outside sources. The result, however, was that due to lack of availability and high demand, they were often turned away or put onto a waitlist. If they were to receive help, they often felt that it did not meet their needs. </p>
            
    <p>All our interviewees said that they would most likely not recommend the Stone Center to a friend, or if they did it would be with the implications that it is not the best permanent or long term solution. Our interviewees also mentioned that there are not many spaces/resources on Wellesley campus where students can resolve their stress, and places off campus were not as accessible due to difficulties in transportation and shortage of time. </p>
            
    <p>Some solutions that our interviewees suggested were providing tips or knowledge of indicators of when students should seek professional help, educating the student population on mental self care tips, revamping the Stone Center website so that it is easier to use, and making off campus health resources more accessible.</p>

    <h1 class="subheading">Problem Statement</h1>
    <p><b>A significant number of Wellesley students are grappling with mental health challenges, yet they often find it difficult to access the necessary resources.</b></p>
    <p>Students at Wellesley are facing stress from academics and future career concerns. The on-campus counseling service, the Stone Center, is overwhelmed and unable to meet the high demand. Long wait times for appointments lead to student frustration and disuse of the service. Additionally, the lack of diversity among Stone Center therapists may limit their effectiveness in supporting students from varied cultural backgrounds. As a result, many students lack adequate support. Seeking external mental health resources is also time-consuming, leaving those in need without sufficient therapy options.</p>

            <p id='pWithGraph'>Wendy, a junior at Wellesley College, is a 20-year-old student athlete majoring in Computer Science with an Economics minor. As a varsity swimmer and the social chair for the Computer Science club, sheâ€™s also immersed in machine learning research at MIT. Her goals are to excel academically, advance her research, lead successful tech events, and qualify for the NCAA DIII National Championships in swimming.</p>
            <p id='pWithGraph'>The challenge for Wendy lies in managing her demanding schedule, which can lead to stress. She understands the importance of self-care and is disciplined about taking breaks to prevent burnout. Leveraging her proficiency with technology, Wendy efficiently balances her studies, research, and personal connections while consciously limiting screen time to stay focused and healthy for her early swim sessions.</p>

                <p id='pWithGraph'>Emily, a 21-year-old senior in college, balances her studies in museum studies with a part-time job at a bookstore. She stays connected through social media and relies on her laptop for schoolwork. Reporting to professors and her job supervisor, she is determined to succeed academically and professionally.</p>

                <p id='pWithGraph'>Despite her drive, Emily faces emotional challenges like financial stress and the pressure of balancing work and school, which sometimes lead to self-doubt. Recognizing her emotional struggles, she values self-care and uses emotional support tools to manage stress. Her proactive approach to emotional well-being is essential as she navigates her demanding life with resilience.</p>
